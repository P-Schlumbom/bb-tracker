a - 'action', only when prompted, does a thing.
m - 'manipulate', transforms image to match markers. Actively tracks the markers in each frame. If it can't see the markers it may throw a hissyfit.
p - remember the currently detected markers and use them until 'p' is pressed again. Use if nothing's going to move. Now you can cover the markers and the program won't even care!
j - decreases webcam focus, use to manually bring image into focus (autofocus can't be trusted!). Focus value printed on console.
l - increases webcam focus, use to manually bring image into focus (autofocus can't be trusted!). Focus value printed on console.
r - 'record', begins recording. Will store position information, video and periodic images in a new file under 'experiment files'.
